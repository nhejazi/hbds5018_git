# Getting `Git` Good for [HBDS 5018](https://phs.weill.cornell.edu/graduate-education-clinical-training/course-catalog/data-science-i-r-and-python)

Version control (a l√° [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)) has been standard practice
in software engineering for decades, and its use has started to become expected
in data science. In order to collaborate effectively, it is imperative to use
version control tools alongside collaborative programming platforms like
[GitHub](https://github.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org).

## A few "good enough" practices

* Commit often; commits serve as "anchor points" in the history of a project.
  You can return to any point in the project history for which there is
  a commit.
* Always work on new branches when adding features or developing a new line of
  work. Name the branches based on the work that they aim to contribute.
* After the work on a branch is completed, create a [pull
  request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to the
  `master` (or `main`) branch of the repository as appropriate.
* I'd recommend reviewing the ["`git` flow" branching
  model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). There are
  other models as well.

n.b., These are _opinionated_ takes of mine, and many may disagree with them. As
you learn more about version control best practices, you may find alternative
guidance that better suit your, and your team's, work style.
